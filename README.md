**Movie-Recommendation-System**


Content-Based Movie Recommendation System: An implementation using Python and NLTK to build a recommendation system based on features like plot, actors, genre, director, producers, production companies, and user ratings.




**Result**


In comparing the recommendations of two recommendation models for movies similar to Spider-Man 3, we can see that Model 1's suggestions, such as "Not Easily Broken" and "Arachnophobia," lacks accuracy as they are actually drama/romance and horror movies, respectively, both lacking similarity to Spider-Man 3. Even though "Arachnophobia" contains keyword Spider, it doesn't share general similarity in perspective of genre or plot. In contrast, Model 2 recommends more accurate choices, such as Hulk, which shares similar genre, plot, and other features like a Superhero movie. Therefore, Model 2 is a more accurate and effective recommendation model.
